Based on adversarial adaptation, we propose a `Pseudo Centroid Alignment Objective` to enforce `Semantic Transfer`.

## Tips for your reproduction of our work.

My work is based on DANN. During my reimplementation of DANN, I noticed following problems worth attention for reproduing DANN and our work MSTN. Hope these could help you. :)

<li> Data Preprocessing </li>
<li> Hyperparameter </li>
